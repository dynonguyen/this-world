<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Samoans settled Niue around A.D. 900, followed by Tongans around 1500.&nbsp; In 1889, tribal chiefs asked the UK for protectorate status, which was granted in 1900. In 1901, Niue was annexed to New Zealand as part of the Cook Islands. Niue became self-governing in 1974, in free association with New Zealand, which is responsible for its defense and foreign affairs. In September 2023, the US recognized Niue as a sovereign and independent state.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 260 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 260 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; modified by southeast trade winds<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>arable land, fish<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 2,000 (2022 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Niuean 65.4%, part-Niuean 14%, non-Niuean 20.6% (2017 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Niuean (official) 46% (a Polynesian language closely related to Tongan and Samoan), Niuean and English 32%, English (official) 11%, Niuean and others 5%, other 6% (2011 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Ekalesia Niue (Congregational Christian Church of Niue - a Protestant church founded by missionaries from the London Missionary Society) 61.7%, Church of Jesus Christ 8.7%, Roman Catholic 8.4%, Jehovah's Witness 2.7%, Seventh Day Adventist 1.4%, other 8.2%, none 8.9% (2017 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>-0.03% (2021 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary democracy<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Alofi<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> King CHARLES III (since 8 September 2022); represented by Governor-General of New Zealand Cindy KIRO (since 21 October 2021); the UK and New Zealand are represented by New Zealand High Commissioner Mark GIBBS (since 5 March 2024)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Premier Dalton TAGELAGI (since 10 June 2020)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral Assembly or Fono Ekepule (20 seats; 14 members directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote and 6 directly elected from the National Register or "common roll" by majority vote; members serve 3-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>upper-middle-income self-governing New Zealand territorial economy; environmentally fragile; massive emigration; post-pandemic tourism rebound; postage stamps, small-scale agricultural processing, and subsistence farming; most recent Asian Development Bank member<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$18.7 million (2021 est.)<br>$19.9 million (2020 est.)<br>$20.9 million (2019 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$11,100 (2021 est.)<br>$11,800 (2020 est.)<br>$12,400 (2019 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>taro, coconuts, fruits, sweet potatoes, tropical fruits, yams, vegetables, lemons/limes, bananas, pork (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>handicrafts, food processing<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$5.68 million (2021 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>US 56%, Brazil 9%, UK 6%, Kuwait 4%, Australia 4% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>broadcasting equipment, abrasive powder, collector's items, coin, milling stones (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$43.8 million (2021 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>UK 46%, NZ 31%, Japan 19%, Brazil 1%, US 1% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>iron structures, ships, refined petroleum, plastic products, cars (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>1.416 (2017 est.)<br>1.4279 (2016 est.)<br>1.4279 (2015)<br>1.4279 (2014 est.)<br>1.2039 (2013 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
