<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured six decades of internal conflicts with armed rebel groups, including a period of civil war in 1979-1982 and a Libyan invasion in the 1980s. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution but has held flawed presidential elections since 1996. The country has struggled with poverty, a weak economy, and terrorist insurgencies.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 1.284 million sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 1,259,200 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 24,800 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical in south, desert in north<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>petroleum, uranium, natron, kaolin, fish (Lake Chad), gold, limestone, sand and gravel, salt<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 19,093,595<br><strong>male:</strong> 9,464,699<br><strong>female:</strong> 9,628,896 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Sara (Ngambaye/Sara/Madjingaye/Mbaye) 30.5%, Kanembu/Bornu/Buduma 9.8%, Arab 9.7%, Wadai/Maba/Masalit/Mimi 7%, Gorane 5.8%, Masa/Musseye/Musgum 4.9%, Bulala/Medogo/Kuka 3.7%, Marba/Lele/Mesme 3.5%, Mundang 2.7%, Bidiyo/Migaama/Kenga/Dangleat 2.5%, Dadjo/Kibet/Muro 2.4%, Tupuri/Kera 2%, Gabri/Kabalaye/Nanchere/Somrai 2%, Fulani/Fulbe/Bodore 1.8%, Karo/Zime/Peve 1.3%, Baguirmi/Barma 1.2%, Zaghawa/Bideyat/Kobe 1.1%, Tama/Assongori/Mararit 1.1%, Mesmedje/Massalat/Kadjakse 0.8%, other Chadian ethnicities 3.4%, Chadians of foreign ethnicities 0.9%, foreign nationals 0.3%, unspecified 1.7% (2014-15 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>French (official), Arabic (official), Sara (in south), more than 120 different languages and dialects<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Muslim 52.1%, Protestant 23.9%, Roman Catholic 20%, animist 0.3%, other Christian 0.2%, none 2.8%, unspecified 0.7% (2014-15 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>3.01% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>presidential republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> N'Djamena<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> Transitional President Mahamat Idriss DEBY (since 20 April 2021); note - on 20 April 2021, newly reelected President Idriss DEBY Itno, Lt.
