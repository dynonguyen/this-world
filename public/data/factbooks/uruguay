<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>The Spanish founded the city of Montevideo in modern-day Uruguay in 1726 as a military stronghold, and it soon became an important commercial center due to its natural harbor. Argentina initially claimed Uruguay, but Brazil annexed the country in 1821. Uruguay declared its independence in 1825 and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 176,215 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 175,015 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 1,200 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>warm temperate; freezing temperatures almost unknown<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>arable land, hydropower, minor minerals, fish<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 3,425,330<br><strong>male:</strong> 1,660,132<br><strong>female:</strong> 1,765,198 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>White 87.7%, Black 4.6%, Indigenous 2.4%, other 0.3%, none or unspecified 5% (2011 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Spanish (official) (many speak the Rioplatense dialect)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Roman Catholic 36.5%, Protestant 5% (Evangelical (non-specific) 4.6%, Adventist 0.2%, Protestant (non-specific) 0.3%), African American Cults/Umbanda 2.8%, Jehovah's Witness 0.6%, Church of Jesus Christ 0.2%, other 1%, Believer (not belonging to the church) 1.8%, agnostic 0.3%, atheist 1.3%, none 47.3%, unspecified 3.4%<br><br>Roman Catholic 42%, Protestant 15%, other 6%, agnostic 3%, atheist 10%, unspecified 24% (2023 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>0.26% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>presidential republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Montevideo<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President Luis Alberto LACALLE POU (since 1 March 2020); Vice President Beatriz ARGIMON Cedeira (since 1 March 2020); the president is both chief of state and head of government<br><strong>head of government:</strong> President Luis Alberto LACALLE POU (since 1 March 2020); Vice President Beatriz ARGIMON Cedeira (since 1 March 2020)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> bicameral General Assembly or Asamblea General consists of:<br>Chamber of Senators or Camara de Senadores (30 seats; members directly elected in a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation vote; the vice-president serves as the presiding ex-officio member; elected members serve 5-year terms)<br>Chamber of Representatives or Camara de Representantes (99 seats; members directly elected in multi-seat constituencies by party-list proportional representation vote using the D'Hondt method; members serve 5-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>high-income, export-oriented South American economy; South Americaâ€™s largest middle class; low socioeconomic inequality; growing homicide rates; growing Chinese and EU relations; 2019 Argentine recession hurt; key milk, beef, rice, and wool exporter<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$83.607 billion (2022 est.)<br>$79.685 billion (2021 est.)<br>$75.692 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$24,400 (2022 est.)<br>$23,300 (2021 est.)<br>$22,100 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>milk, rice, wheat, barley, soybeans, beef, rapeseed, sugarcane, maize, oranges (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>food processing, electrical machinery, transportation equipment, petroleum products, textiles, chemicals, beverages<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$22.565 billion (2022 est.)<br>$19.527 billion (2021 est.)<br>$13.851 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>China 24%, Brazil 14%, Argentina 8%, US 7%, Netherlands 5% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>beef, wood pulp, soybeans, milk, rice (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$18.894 billion (2022 est.)<br>$15.125 billion (2021 est.)<br>$11.43 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>Brazil 20%, China 18%, US 15%, Argentina 11%, Germany 3% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>crude petroleum, fertilizers, cars, packaged medicine, broadcasting equipment (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Uruguayan pesos (UYU) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>41.171 (2022 est.)<br>43.555 (2021 est.)<br>42.013 (2020 est.)<br>35.255 (2019 est.)<br>30.725 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
