<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 912,050 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 882,050 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 30,000 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; hot, humid; more moderate in highlands<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, bauxite, other minerals, hydropower, diamonds<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 31,250,306<br><strong>male:</strong> 15,555,451<br><strong>female:</strong> 15,694,855 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>unspecified Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arab, German, African, Indigenous<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Spanish (official) 98.2%, indigenous 1.3%, Portuguese 0.1%, other 0.4% (2023 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Roman Catholic 48.1%, Protestant 31.6% (Evangelical 31.4%, Adventist 0.2%), Jehovah's Witness 1.4%, African American/umbanda 0.7%, other 0.1%, believer 3.5%, agnostic 0.1%, atheist, 0.4%, none 13.6%, unspecified 0.6% (2023 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>2.34% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>federal presidential republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Caracas<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> Notification Statement: the United States does not recognize Nicolas MADURO Moros as president of Venezuela<br><br>President Nicolas MADURO Moros (since 19 April 2013); Executive Vice President Delcy RODRIGUEZ Gomez (since 14 June 2018); note - the president is both chief of state and head of government<br><strong>head of government:</strong> President Nicolas MADURO Moros (since 19 April 2013); Executive Vice President Delcy RODRIGUEZ Gomez (since 14 June 2018)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral National Assembly or Asamblea Nacional (277 seats; 3 seats reserved for indigenous peoples of Venezuela; members serve 5-year terms); note - in 2020, the National Electoral Council increased the number of seats in the National Assembly from 167 to 277 for the 6 December 2020 election<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>South American economy; ongoing hyperinflation since mid-2010s; chaotic economy due to political corruption, infrastructure cuts, and human rights abuses; in debt default; oil exporter; hydropower consumer; rising Chinese relations<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$269.068 billion (2018 est.)<br>$381.6 billion (2017 est.)<br>$334.751 billion (2017 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$7,704 (2018 est.)<br>$12,500 (2017 est.)<br>$9,417 (2017 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>milk, sugarcane, maize, plantains, oil palm fruit, bananas, rice, potatoes, pineapples, chicken (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>agricultural products, livestock, raw materials, machinery and equipment, transport equipment, construction materials, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, iron and steel products, crude oil and petroleum products<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$83.401 billion (2018 est.)<br>$93.485 billion (2017 est.)<br>$28.684 billion (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>China 16%, Turkey 14%, Spain 12%, US 10%, Brazil 8% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>scrap iron, petroleum coke, crude petroleum, acyclic alcohols, aluminum (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$18.432 billion (2018 est.)<br>$18.376 billion (2017 est.)<br>$25.81 billion (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>China 31%, US 23%, Brazil 14%, Colombia 7%, Turkey 4% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>soybean oil, wheat, soybean meal, corn, plastic products (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>bolivars (VEB) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>9.975 (2017 est.)<br>9.257 (2016 est.)<br>6.284 (2015 est.)<br>6.284 (2014 est.)<br>6.048 (2013 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
