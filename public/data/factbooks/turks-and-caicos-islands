<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown colony upon Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed, and the islands remain a British overseas territory.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 948 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 948 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; marine; moderated by trade winds; sunny and relatively dry<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>spiny lobster, conch<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 60,439<br><strong>male:</strong> 30,389<br><strong>female:</strong> 30,050 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Black 87.6%, White 7.9%, mixed 2.5%, East Indian 1.3%, other 0.7% (2006 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>English (official)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Protestant 72.8% (Baptist 35.8%, Church of God 11.7%, Anglican 10%, Methodist 9.3%, Seventh Day Adventist 6%), Roman Catholic 11.4%, Jehovah's Witness 1.8%, other 14% (2006 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>1.77% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary democracy<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Grand Turk (Cockburn Town)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> King CHARLES III (since 8 September 2022); represented by Governor Dileeni Daniel-SELVARATNAM (since 29 June 2023)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Premier Washington MISICK (since 19 February 2021)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral House of Assembly (21 seats; 15 members in multi-seat constituencies and a single all-islands constituency directly elected by simple majority vote, 1 member nominated by the premier and appointed by the governor, 1 nominated by the opposition party leader and appointed by the governor, and 2 from the Turks and Caicos Islands Civic Society directly appointed by the governor, and 2 ex-officio members; members serve 4-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>British Caribbean island territorial economy; GDP and its tourism industry hit hard by COVID-19 disruptions; major biodiversity locale; US dollar user; fossil fuel dependent; negative trade balance; increasing unemployment<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$946.893 million (2022 est.)<br>$891.613 million (2021 est.)<br>$817.993 million (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$20,700 (2022 est.)<br>$19,800 (2021 est.)<br>$18,500 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>corn, beans, cassava (manioc, tapioca), citrus fruits; fish<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>tourism, offshore financial services<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$826.824 million (2018 est.)<br>$602.581 million (2017 est.)<br>$741.173 million (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>Togo 61%, US 13%, Zimbabwe 6%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 3%, Central African Republic 2% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>fertilizers, shellfish, plastics, sulfur, soybean oil (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$544.219 million (2018 est.)<br>$484.842 million (2017 est.)<br>$438.041 million (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>US 75%, Dominican Republic 6%, Italy 3%, Switzerland 2%, China 2% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>refined petroleum, cars, plastic products, furniture, aluminum structures (2022)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
