<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>A Malay trading port known as Temasek existed on the island of Singapore by the 14th century. The settlement changed hands several times and was eventually burned in the 17th century. In 1819, the British founded modern Singapore as a trading colony on the same site. It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but was ousted two years later and became independent.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 719 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 709.2 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 10 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; hot, humid, rainy; two distinct monsoon seasons - northeastern monsoon (December to March) and southwestern monsoon (June to September); inter-monsoon - frequent afternoon and early evening thunderstorms<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>fish, deepwater ports<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 6,028,459<br><strong>male:</strong> 3,013,630<br><strong>female:</strong> 3,014,829 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Chinese 74.2%, Malay 13.7%, Indian 8.9%, other 3.2% (2021 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>English (official) 48.3%, Mandarin (official) 29.9%, other Chinese dialects (includes Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka) 8.7%, Malay (official) 9.2%, Tamil (official) 2.5%, other 1.4%; note - data represent language most frequently spoken at home (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Buddhist 31.1%, Christian 18.9%, Muslim 15.6%, Taoist 8.8%, Hindu 5%, other 0.6%, none 20% (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>0.87% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Singapore<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President THARMAN Shanmugaratnam (since 14 September 2023)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Prime Minister Lawrence WONG (since 15 May 2024)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral Parliament (104 seats statutory, 103 current term; 93 members directly elected by simple majority popular vote, up to 9 nominated by a parliamentary selection committee and appointed by the president, and up to 12 non-constituency members from opposition parties to ensure political diversity; members serve 5-year terms); note - the number of nominated members increased to 12 for the 2020 election for the first time<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>high-income, service-based Southeast Asian economy; renowned for financial markets and Asian Infrastructure Exchange; business-driven regulations; low unemployment; electronics, oil, and chemicals exporter; continuing education investment<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$609.002 billion (2022 est.)<br>$587.573 billion (2021 est.)<br>$539.641 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$108,000 (2022 est.)<br>$107,700 (2021 est.)<br>$94,900 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>chicken, eggs, pork, vegetables, duck, spinach, pork offal, pork fat, cabbages, lettuce (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>electronics, chemicals, financial services, oil drilling equipment, petroleum refining, biomedical products, scientific instruments, telecommunication equipment, processed food and beverages, ship repair, offshore platform construction, entrepot trade<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$870.806 billion (2022 est.)<br>$781.068 billion (2021 est.)<br>$634.034 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>Hong Kong 14%, China 13%, Malaysia 9%, US 8%, Indonesia 6% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>integrated circuits, refined petroleum, machinery, gold, gas turbines (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$701.629 billion (2022 est.)<br>$631.615 billion (2021 est.)<br>$525.324 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>China 17%, Malaysia 13%, US 10%, Taiwan 9%, South Korea 5% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>integrated circuits, refined petroleum, crude petroleum, gold, machinery (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Singapore dollars (SGD) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>1.379 (2022 est.)<br>1.343 (2021 est.)<br>1.38 (2020 est.)<br>1.364 (2019 est.)<br>1.349 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Tuesday, May 28, 2024</p></span>
