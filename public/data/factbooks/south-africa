<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>By about A.D. 500, Bantu-speaking groups settled into northeastern South Africa. Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of present-day South Africa in 1652. The British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806. British and Afrikaners (Dutch descendants) ruled jointly from 1910 to 1961 in the Union of South Africa. The African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to apartheid. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 followed the end of apartheid.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 1,219,090 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 1,214,470 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 4,620 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>mostly semiarid;
