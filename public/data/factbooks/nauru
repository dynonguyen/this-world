<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Micronesian and Polynesian settlers inhabited Nauru by 1000 B.C. In 1798, the British spotted the island, and Germany annexed it in 1888. Australia captured Nauru from Germany during World War I, and in 1919, it became a joint Australian-British-New Zealand mandate with Australian administration. Nauru opted for independence in 1968.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 21 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 21 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical with a monsoonal pattern; rainy season (November to February)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>phosphates, fish<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 9,892<br><strong>male:</strong> 4,856<br><strong>female:</strong> 5,036 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Nauruan 94.6%, I-Kiribati 2.2%, Fijian 1.3%, other 1.9% (2021 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Nauruan 93% (official, a distinct Pacific Island language), English 2% (widely understood, spoken, and used for most government and commercial purposes), other 5% (includes Gilbertese 2% and Chinese 2%) (2011 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Protestant 60.4% (Nauruan Congregational 34.7%, Assemblies of God 11.6%, Pacific Light House 6.3%, Nauru Independent 3.6%, Baptist 1.5, Seventh Day Adventist 1.3%, other Protestant 1.4%), Roman Catholic 33.9%, other 4.2%, none 1.3%, no answer 0.3% (2021 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>0.39% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> no official capital; government offices in the Yaren District<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President David ADEANG (since 30 October 2023); note - the president is both chief of state and head of government<br><strong>head of government:</strong> President David ADEANG (since 30 October 2023)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral Parliament (19 seats; members directly elected in multi-seat constituencies by majority vote using the "Dowdall" counting system by which voters rank candidates on their ballots; members serve 3-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>upper-middle-income Pacific island country; phosphate resource exhaustion made island interior uninhabitable; licenses fishing rights; houses Australiaâ€™s Regional Processing Centre; former tax haven; largely dependent on foreign subsidies<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$139.656 million (2022 est.)<br>$137.491 million (2021 est.)<br>$133.161 million (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$11,000 (2022 est.)<br>$11,000 (2021 est.)<br>$10,800 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>coconuts, tropical fruits, pork, eggs, pork offal, pork fat, chicken, papayas, vegetables, cabbages (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>phosphate mining, offshore banking, coconut products<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$187 million (2021 est.)<br>$105 million (2020 est.)<br>$32.7 million (2019 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>Thailand 59%, Philippines 19%, South Korea 11%, India 3%, Japan 2% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>fish, phosphates, gas turbines, power equipment, plastic products (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$94.2 million (2021 est.)<br>$103 million (2020 est.)<br>$88.2 million (2019 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>Australia 47%, China 17%, Japan 12%, Fiji 11%, NZ 2% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>ships, plastic products, other foods, cars, refined petroleum (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>1.442 (2022 est.)<br>1.331 (2021 est.)<br>1.453 (2020 est.)<br>1.439 (2019 est.)<br>1.338 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Monday, June 10, 2024</p></span>
