<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Barbados was uninhabited when first settled by the British in 1627. By 1720, the island was no longer a dominant force within the sugar industry, having been surpassed by the Leeward Islands and Jamaica. Social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to independence from the UK in 1966. In 2021, Barbados became a republic.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 430 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 430 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; rainy season (June to October)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>petroleum, fish, natural gas<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 304,139<br><strong>male:</strong> 146,587<br><strong>female:</strong> 157,552 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>African descent 92.4%, mixed 3.1%, White 2.7%, East Indian 1.3%, other 0.2%, unspecified 0.3% (2010 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>English (official), Bajan (English-based creole language, widely spoken in informal settings)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Protestant 66.4% (includes Anglican 23.9%, other Pentecostal 19.5%, Adventist 5.9%, Methodist 4.2%, Wesleyan 3.4%, Nazarene 3.2%, Church of God 2.4%, Baptist 1.8%, Moravian 1.2%, other Protestant 0.9%), Roman Catholic 3.8%, other Christian 5.4% (includes Jehovah's Witness 2.0%, other 3.4%), Rastafarian 1%, other 1.5%, none 20.6%, unspecified 1.2% (2010 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>0.23% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary republic; a Commonwealth realm<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Bridgetown<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President Sandra MASON (since 30 November 2021)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Prime Minister Mia MOTTLEY (since 25 May 2018)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> bicameral Parliament consists of:<br>Senate (21 seats statutory - 21 current; members appointed by the president - 12 on the advice of the prime minister, 2 on the advice of the opposition leader, and 7 at the discretion of the president; members serve 5-year terms)<br>House of Assembly (30 seats; members directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote to serve 5-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>largest Eastern Caribbean economy; dependent on US imports and currency strength; high Human Development Index; key tourism and financial sectors; declining but still very high public debt; cost-of-living and cost competitiveness vulnerabilities<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$4.342 billion (2022 est.)<br>$3.9 billion (2021 est.)<br>$3.931 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$15,400 (2022 est.)<br>$13,900 (2021 est.)<br>$14,000 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>sugarcane, chicken, vegetables, milk, eggs, sweet potatoes, pork, coconuts, cantaloupes/melons, tropical fruits (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>tourism, sugar, light manufacturing, component assembly for export<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$2.228 billion (2017 est.)<br>$2.41 billion (2016 est.)<br>$2.358 billion (2015 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>US 23%, Jamaica 11%, Trinidad and Tobago 9%, Guyana 8%, Poland 6% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>liquor, packaged medicine, ships, paper labels, baked goods (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$2.12 billion (2021 est.)<br>$2.213 billion (2017 est.)<br>$2.238 billion (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>US 43%, China 8%, Trinidad and Tobago 7%, UK 5%, Netherlands 3% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>refined petroleum, plastic products, cars, railway cargo containers, packaged medicine (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Barbadian dollars (BBD) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>2 (2022 est.)<br>2 (2021 est.)<br>2 (2020 est.)<br>2 (2019 est.)<br>2 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
