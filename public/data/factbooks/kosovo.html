Kosovo declared its independence in 2008 and formally applied for EU membership in 2022.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 10,887 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 10,887 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>influenced by continental air masses resulting in relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot, dry summers and autumns;
