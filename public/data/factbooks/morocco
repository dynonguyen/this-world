<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, a series of Muslim dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. In 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. Morocco won a protracted independence struggle with France in 1956.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 716,550 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 716,300 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 250 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>Mediterranean in the north, becoming more extreme in the interior; in the south, hot, dry desert; rain is rare; cold offshore air currents produce fog and heavy dew<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>phosphates, iron ore, manganese, lead, zinc, fish, salt<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 37,387,585<br><strong>male:</strong> 18,664,263<br><strong>female:</strong> 18,723,322 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Arab-Amazigh 99%, other 1%<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Arabic (official), Tamazight languages (Tamazight (official), Tachelhit, Tarifit), French (often the language of business, government, and diplomacy); note - the proportion of Tamazight speakers is disputed<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Muslim 99% (official; virtually all Sunni, &lt;0.1% Shia), other 1% (includes Christian, Jewish, and Baha'i); note - Jewish about 3,000-3,500 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>0.84% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary constitutional monarchy<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Rabat<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> King MOHAMMED VI (since 30 July 1999)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Prime Minister Aziz AKHANNOUCH (since 7 October 2021)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> bicameral Parliament consists of:<br>House of Councillors or Majlis al-Mustacharine (120 seats; members indirectly elected by an electoral college of local councils, professional organizations, and labor unions; members serve 6-year terms)<br>House of Representatives or Majlis al-Nuwab (395 seats; 305 members directly elected in multi-seat constituencies by proportional representation vote and 90 directly elected in a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation vote; members serve 5-year terms); note - 60 seats reserved for women and 30 seats for those under age 40 in regional multi-seat constituencies, with the seats divided proportionally among the 12 regions by population size of the region<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>lower middle-income North African economy; ongoing recovery from recent drought and earthquake; rebounding via tourism, manufacturing, and raw materials processing; significant trade and investment with EU; reform programs include fiscal rebalancing, state enterprise governance and private sector investments<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$307.442 billion (2022 est.)<br>$303.621 billion (2021 est.)<br>$281.076 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$8,100 (2022 est.)<br>$8,100 (2021 est.)<br>$7,500 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>wheat, milk, olives, sugar beets, potatoes, tomatoes, tangerines/mandarins, oranges, apples, onions (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>automotive parts, phosphate mining and processing, aerospace, food processing, leather goods, textiles, construction, energy, tourism<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$58.556 billion (2022 est.)<br>$47.09 billion (2021 est.)<br>$37.545 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>Spain 18%, France 17%, India 6%, Italy 5%, Brazil 4% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>fertilizers, cars, garments, insulated wire, phosphoric acid (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$73.783 billion (2022 est.)<br>$60.215 billion (2021 est.)<br>$46.358 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>Spain 18%, France 10%, China 10%, US 6%, Saudi Arabia 6% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>refined petroleum, wheat, natural gas, coal, vehicle parts/accessories (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>10.161 (2022 est.)<br>8.988 (2021 est.)<br>9.497 (2020 est.)<br>9.617 (2019 est.)<br>9.386 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Tuesday, June 11, 2024</p></span>
