<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the English in 1672. The islands were part of the British colony of the Leeward Islands (1872-1960); they were granted autonomy in 1967. They maintain strong ties to the nearby US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 151 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 151 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>subtropical; humid; temperatures moderated by trade winds<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>NEGL; pleasant climate, beaches foster tourism<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 40,102<br><strong>male:</strong> 19,042<br><strong>female:</strong> 21,060 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>African/Black 76.3%, Latino 5.5%, White 5.4%, mixed 5.3%, Indian 2.1%, East Indian 1.6%, other 3%, unspecified 0.8% (2010 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>English (official), Virgin Islands Creole<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Protestant 70.2% (Methodist 17.6%, Church of God 10.4%, Anglican 9.5%, Seventh Day Adventist 9.0%, Pentecostal 8.2%, Baptist 7.4%, New Testament Church of God 6.9%, other Protestant 1.2%), Roman Catholic 8.9%, Jehovah's Witness 2.5%, Hindu 1.9%, other 6.2%, none 7.9%, unspecified 2.4% (2010 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>1.82% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>Overseas Territory of the UK with limited self-government; parliamentary democracy<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Road Town<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> King CHARLES III (since 8 September 2022); represented by Governor Daniel PRUCE (since 29 January 2024)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Premier Dr. Natalio WHEATLEY (since 5 May 2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> unicameral House of Assembly (15 seats; 13 members - 9 in single-seat constituencies and 4 members in a single, nationwide constituency directly elected by simple majority vote and 2 ex-officio members - the attorney general and the speaker - chosen from outside the House; members serve 4-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>British Caribbean island territorial economy; strong tourism and services industries; vulnerable to hurricanes; navigating public debt insolvency since 2008 Crisis; considered a tax haven; high electrification costs; major rum exporter<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$500 million (2017 est.)<br>$490.2 million (2016 est.)<br>$481.1 million (2015 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$34,200 (2017 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>fruits, vegetables; livestock, poultry; fish<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>tourism, light industry, construction, rum, concrete block, offshore banking center<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$23 million (2017 est.)<br>$23 million (2015 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>Malta 30%, Seychelles 29%, Switzerland 14% (2019)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>aircraft, recreational boats, ships, hydrogen, halogens (2021)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$300 million (2017 est.)<br>$210 million (2016 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>Germany 32%, United States 22%, Italy 9%, France 7%, Seychelles 7% (2019)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>recreational boats, aircraft, refined petroleum, cars, furniture (2019)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Thursday, June 06, 2024</p></span>
