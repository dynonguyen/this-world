<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Resistance from native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. France and England disputed the island for most of the 18th century, but it was ceded to England in 1783. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 389 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 389 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 0 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical; little seasonal temperature variation; rainy season (May to November)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>hydropower, arable land<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 100,647<br><strong>male:</strong> 51,249<br><strong>female:</strong> 49,398 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>African descent 71.2%, mixed 23%, Indigenous 3%, East Indian/Indian 1.1%, European 1.5%, other 0.2% (2012 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>English, Vincentian Creole English, French patois<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Protestant 75% (Pentecostal 27.6%, Anglican 13.9%, Seventh Day Adventist 11.6%,&nbsp; Baptist 8.9%, Methodist 8.7%, Evangelical 3.8%, Salvation Army 0.3%, Presbyterian/Congregational 0.3%), Roman Catholic 6.3%,&nbsp; Rastafarian 1.1%, Jehovah's Witness 0.8%, other 4.7%, none 7.5%, unspecified 4.7% (2012 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>-0.15% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy; a Commonwealth realm<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Kingstown<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> King CHARLES III (since 8 September 2022); represented by Governor General Susan DOUGAN (since 1 August 2019)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Prime Minister Ralph E.
