<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 after Christopher COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917 but have had self-government since 1952. Decades of plebiscites showed that voters did not want to alter the existing political status with the US, but a 2020 vote showed a narrow preference for American statehood.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 9,104 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 8,959 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 145 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>tropical marine, mild; little seasonal temperature variation<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>some copper and nickel; potential for onshore and offshore oil<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 3,019,450<br><strong>male:</strong> 1,418,753<br><strong>female:</strong> 1,600,697 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>White 75.8%, Black/African American 12.4%, other 8.5% (includes American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, and others), mixed 3.3% (2010 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Spanish, English<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Roman Catholic 56%, Protestant 33% (largely Pentecostal), other 2%, atheist 1%, none 7% (2014 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>-1.2% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>unincorporated organized territory of the US with local self-government; republican form of territorial government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches; note - reference Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act, 2 March 1917, as amended by Public Law 600, 3 July 1950<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> San Juan<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President Joseph R.
