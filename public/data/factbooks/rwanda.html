<div id="introduction" class=""><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Background</h3><p>A Rwandan kingdom dominated the Great Lakes region from the mid-18th century onward, with Tutsi rulers conquering others militarily and centralizing power. German colonial conquest began in the late 1890s, but the territory was ceded to Belgian forces in 1916 during World War I. Rwandan independence came in 1962. Conflict between Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups continued for decades, including genocide in 1994. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first presidential and legislative elections in 2003.<br></p></div></div><div id="geography" class=""><h2>Geography</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Area</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 26,338 sq km<br><strong>land:</strong> 24,668 sq km<br><strong>water:</strong> 1,670 sq km<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Climate</h3><p>temperate; two rainy seasons (February to April, November to January); mild in mountains with frost and snow possible<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Natural resources</h3><p>gold, cassiterite (tin ore), wolframite (tungsten ore), methane, hydropower, arable land<br></p></div></div><div id="people-and-society" class=""><h2>People and Society</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Population</h3><p><strong>total:</strong> 13,623,302<br><strong>male:</strong> 6,684,655<br><strong>female:</strong> 6,938,647 (2024 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Ethnic groups</h3><p>Hutu, Tutsi, Twa<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Languages</h3><p>Kinyarwanda (official, universal Bantu vernacular) 93.2%, French (official) &lt;0.1, English (official) &lt;0.1, Swahili/Kiswahili (official, used in commercial centers) &lt;0.1, more than one language, other 6.3%, unspecified 0.3% (2002 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Religions</h3><p>Christian 95.9% (Protestant 57.7% [includes Adventist 12.6%], Roman Catholic 38.2%), Muslim 2.1%, other 1% (includes traditional, Jehovah's Witness), none 1.1% (2019-20 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Population growth rate</h3><p>1.62% (2024 est.)<br></p></div></div><div id="government" class=""><h2>Government</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Government type</h3><p>presidential republic<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Capital</h3><p><strong>name:</strong> Kigali<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Executive branch</h3><p><strong>chief of state:</strong> President Paul KAGAME (since 22 April 2000)<br><strong>head of government:</strong> Prime Minister Edouard NGIRENTE (since 30 August 2017)&nbsp;<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Legislative branch</h3><p><strong>description:</strong> bicameral Parliament consists of:<br>Senate or Senat (26 seats; 12 members indirectly elected by local councils, 8 appointed by the president, 4 appointed by the Political Organizations Forum - a body of registered political parties, and 2 selected by institutions of higher learning; members serve 8-year terms)<br><br>Chamber of Deputies or Chambre des Deputes (80 seats; 53 members directly elected by proportional representation vote, 24 women selected by special interest groups, and 3 selected by youth and disability organizations; members serve 5-year terms)<br></p></div></div><div id="economy" class=""><h2>Economy</h2><div><h3 class="mt30">Economic overview</h3><p>fast-growing Sub-Saharan economy; major public investments; trade and tourism hit hard by COVID-19; increasing poverty after 2 decades of declines; Ugandan competition for regional influence; major coffee exporter; contested GDP figures<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP (purchasing power parity)</h3><p>$32.579 billion (2022 est.)<br>$30.121 billion (2021 est.)<br>$27.167 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Real GDP per capita</h3><p>$2,400 (2022 est.)<br>$2,200 (2021 est.)<br>$2,100 (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Agricultural products</h3><p>bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes, potatoes, plantains, maize, beans, pumpkins/squash, taro, sorghum (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Industries</h3><p>cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports</h3><p>$2.993 billion (2022 est.)<br>$2.11 billion (2021 est.)<br>$1.929 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - partners</h3><p>UAE 32%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 25%, Thailand 5%, US 3%, Ethiopia 3% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exports - commodities</h3><p>gold, tin ores, coffee, malt extract, rare earth ores (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports</h3><p>$4.98 billion (2022 est.)<br>$3.856 billion (2021 est.)<br>$3.578 billion (2020 est.)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - partners</h3><p>China 19%, Tanzania 11%, Kenya 10%, UAE 10%, India 7% (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Imports - commodities</h3><p>refined petroleum, gold, palm oil, rice, raw sugar (2022)<br></p></div><div><h3 class="mt30">Exchange rates</h3><p>Rwandan francs (RWF) per US dollar -<br><strong>Exchange rates:</strong><br>1,030.308 (2022 est.)<br>988.625 (2021 est.)<br>943.278 (2020 est.)<br>899.351 (2019 est.)<br>861.093 (2018 est.)<br></p></div></div><span><hr><p>Page last updated:<!-- --> Tuesday, June 11, 2024</p></span>
